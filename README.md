# AObench on R7RS scheme

ported from https://code.google.com/p/aobench

	aoench is a small ambient occlusion renderer for benchmarking realworld
	floating point performance in various languages.
	aobench is originally coded in "Proce55ing":http://processing.org/.
	aoench consists just about 400 lines of code and requires only standard
	math functions, therefore it is easy to understand and port aoench for
	your favorite language.
